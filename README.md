# R Studio Basketball Project
This project involves utilizing NBA basketball rookie data to assess how each of the top rookies have been performing. This project involves web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization methods within R Studio.
The goal was to observe how both the 2019 and 2020 classes performed and compare the two. In addition, the second half of the project involved compared the most watched television broadcasts in the US. The last part involved visualizing the top rated broadcasts in a cool neat gif animation. The source of the NBA data was from [basketballreference] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
